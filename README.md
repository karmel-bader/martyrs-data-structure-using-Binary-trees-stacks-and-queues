In this project, a new martyrsâ€™ data structure using Binary trees, stacks, and queues is implemented. For a good user experience, a graphical user interface (GUI) using javaFX is implemented.

Then to load Districts in a BST of Districts, every district has a BST of loactions, every location has a tree of dates, and every date has a Single Linked List of martyrs
